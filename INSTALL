mdz Installation
=================

You need development versions of the following libraries:

 * GTK2
 * libpng 
 * pkg-config
 * mpfr
 * pthreads

Unless you know what you're doing it is strongly recommended to use
the development packages provided by your Linux distribution's package
manager.

Once the library dependacies are satisified:

  cd src
  make
  sudo make install
