mdz Installation
=================

You need development versions of the following libraries:

 * GTK2
 * libpng 1.0.3. 1.0.3 has a crucial bug-fix so earlier versions don't work.
 * libpng requires zlib. 1.1.2 works for me.
 * pkg-config
 * mpfr
 * pthreads

Unless you know what you're doing it is strongly recommended to use
the development packages provided by your Linux distribution's package
manager.

Once the library dependacies are satisified:

  cd src
  make
  sudo make install
