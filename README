mdz is a Mandelbrot-Set image generator which can use arbitrary precision
maths to zoom in as deep as you have patience for.

mdz is a fork from gkII ( http://www.jwm-art.net/gkII ) which in turn
is a fork of gfract ( http://code.google.com/p/gfract/ ).

mdz has stripped out most of the features from gkII and improves
performance with multi-threaded rendering, and adds the ability to
zoom really deep with arbitrary precision math.

----------

command line options

the command line options are specifically for those cases where you
want to render an image without interacting with the program at all.
or, the command line options can be used to render a 'final' image,
and the gui should be thought of as more for exploration (infact for
the new features coming in 0.0.6 i am considering limiting the image
size because certain features will require even more memory).

----------

         ***** IF YOU SEE BIG BLOCKY PIXELS *****

BY DEFAULT THE ARBITRARY MATHS ROUTINES ARE TURNED OFF. YOU MUST ENABLE
THEM IN THE IMAGE->ATTRIBUTES DIALOG. arbitrary maths routines are not
required until zooming has taken you into a sufficient depth. At this
stage, the arbitrary maths routines must be manually switched on, but
you will see when you need them as the images become blocky.

You may specify how much precision to use with the arbitrary maths
routines. The minimum setting mdz allows is 80 bits. Once you find
you need the arbitrary maths routines, it's worth increasing it to
128.

Warning: the arbitrary maths routines are slow in comparison, and the
deeper you zoom, and the more precision you ask for, the slower the
calculations will become. You'll need a lot of patience or a very fast
computer to really need more than 128 bits of precision.

-----------

threading

the default number of rendering threads is 64 which might seem rather
arbitrary. you can increase or decrease this value by using the --threads
command line option followed by the number you require. note however mdz
may decide to use less anyway, depending on the image size. this is my
first multi-threaded program i have written, and in my tests, the best
performance was yeilded by a high number of threads such as 256.


-----------
mdz development

mdz will not be able to generate other types of fractals or other colouring
methods. mdz is focused upon exploration of the Mandelbrot-Set using the
standard colouring method only with the concept being that the Mandelbrot-Set
is in fact complex enough to actually simulate other colouring methods should
the explorer have the patience and knowledge to find them ;-)


-----------

colour palettes

mdz can read fractint .map colour palette files and can save them too.
