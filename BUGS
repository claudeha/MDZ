Known bugs:

 * palette offset and image dimensions are forgotten when
   a new instance is created (via duplicate or zoom-in-
   new-window).

 * within the mdz gui, the M-set inside colour is always
   drawn as black, but unless anti-aliasing or colour-scaling
   is set, the inside colour in the saved PNG image file is
   as the first indexed colour in the colour map.
