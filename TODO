for mdz-0.0.6 i'm planning on implementing the following:

* allow zoom and reposition tools to be switched between without
  depressing the currently selected tool (ie make it work like
  any other tool bar).

* options to adjust size of image generated without scaling, and
  provide option to scale by y instead of always by x.

* size adjustment without scaling should not require the entire
  window to be recalculated, nor should repositioning. (ie make
  it possible to render specific parts of the image).

* store which lines have pixels within the inside of the M-set
  such that when only the iterations are increased, only these
  lines are recalculated.

* a crop tool, maybe, but it's rather low on my list of priorities.

* the colours/palette stuff needs some more attention somewhere.
