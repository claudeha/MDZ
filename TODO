Todo RIGHT AT THIS VERY MOMENT!

 * Testing GMP rendering speeds over MPFR rendering speeds.
   GMP seems faster. May keep GMP rendering as an option.


Todo currently:

 * When zoom-in-new window or duplicate is used the following settings
   should be transferred to the new instance:
        * palette offset
        * image dimension
    (currently these settings are 'forgotten').

Todo for consideration:

 * investigate smooth colouring
 * investigate guessing algorithm + zoom optimization

Todo long term:

 * only draw parts of image that are necessary (ie after reposition).
 * more control over viewport scaling + resizing.
