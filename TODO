Todo that I can do:
 * Button to pause-rendering.
 * Show render time.

Todo for consideration if I ever get betterer at maffs innit
(or someone else does it for me):

 * investigate smooth colouring (instead of colour-bands)
 * investigate guessing algorithm + zoom optimization

Todo long term:

 * only draw parts of image that are necessary (ie after reposition).
 * more control over viewport scaling + resizing.
 * rendering daemon that starts in background at boot time. connect via
   networking to send jobs to. jobs queued, 1st come 1st served.
